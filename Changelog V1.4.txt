- Schematic (visual): functionnal block for HIGH side measurements
- Removed NGND MOS and associated drive circuit (optocoupler), replaced by smaller MOS to control low side
electrolytic capacitor connexion to ground
- Removed TEA 1-0505 as we don't have NGND anymore
- MCP1799T-5002H/TT (U504) : 5V LDO for 5V_PGND generation replaced by MCP1799T-5002H/DB for better thermal dissipation
- TBA 1-0512 replaced by SMU02L-12 (Meanwell) (2W)
