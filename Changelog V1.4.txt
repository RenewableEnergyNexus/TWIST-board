- Schematic (visual): functionnal block for HIGH side measurements
- Removed NGND MOS and associated drive circuit (optocoupler)
- Removed TEA 1-0505 as we don't have NGND anymore
- MCP1799T-5002H/TT (U504) : 5V LDO for 5V_PGND generation replaced by MCP1799T-5002H/TT for better thermal dissipation
- Added MOS in serial of low side electrolitic cap and its drive circuit (optocoupler)
